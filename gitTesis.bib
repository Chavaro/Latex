abstract = {Wireless networks are passing through a transition phase for the past few years now and this transition is giving a way towards the convergence of all IP-based networks to form the Next Generation Networks (NGNs). With the proliferation of these networks in daily life, users' needs are also increasing and service operators are offering different services to satisfy their customers for a better grade of service and an elevated quality of experience (QoE). However, a single operator cannot fulfill the huge demands of the users especially, if a user is nomadic. In nomadism, a user traverses number of available networks that might contain cellular or wireless data networks, usually known as heterogeneous wireless networks. These networks offer various services from email to live video streaming depending upon their capacity and nature. During this traversing procedure, a user switches among different networks to satisfy his/her needs in terms of quality of service. This process is commonly known as a vertical handover or handoff (VHO) due to the involvement of heterogeneous wireless networks in it. An extensive work has been carried out in this field in order to fulfill user demands for better QoS and QoE. In this paper, we give a detailed state-of-the-art of these existing vertical handover decision mechanisms that aim at providing ubiquitous connectivity to the mobile users. We have categorized these vertical handover measurement and decision schemes on the basis of their employed techniques and parameters. Also, we present a comprehensive summary of their advantages and drawbacks. This paper gives its readers an overview of the active research initiatives in the area of handover decision making process in heterogeneous wireless networks and identifies the challenges behind the seamless services provisioning during mobility.},

abstract = {We consider the motion of a spinning relativistic particle in external electromagnetic and gravitational fields, to first order in the external field, but to an arbitrary order in spin. The noncovariant spin formalism is crucial for the correct description of the influence of the spin on the particle trajectory. We show that the true coordinate of a relativistic spinning particle is its naive, common coordinate. Concrete calculations are performed up to second order in spin included. A simple derivation is presented for the gravitational spin-orbit and spin-spin interactions of a relativistic particle. We discuss the gravimagnetic moment (GM), a specific spin effect in general relativity. It is shown that for the Kerr black hole the gravimagnetic ratio, i.e., the coefficient at the GM, equals unity (just as for the charged Kerr hole the gyromagnetic ratio equals two). The equations of motion obtained for relativistic spinning particle in external gravitational field differ essentially from the Papapetrou equations.},

abstract = {Verifiable secret sharing (VSS) has been extensively used as a cryptographic tool in many applications of information security in recent years. A VSS enables a dealer to divide a secret s into n shares and allows shareholders to verify whether their shares are generated by the dealer consistently without revealing the secrecy of both shares and the secret. More specifically, shareholders can verify that (i) the secret can be recovered by any t or more than t shares and (ii) the secret cannot be obtained by fewer than t shares. Many VSSs are based on polynomial, and only a few of them are based on the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT). Recently, Harn et al. proposed a CRT-based VSS in which multiple verification secrets are used during the phase of verification. In this paper, we propose a VSS based on Asmuth-Bloom’s(t, n)SS scheme, which depends on the CRT. Our proposed VSS is simpler and more efficient than the scheme of Harn et al. Our proposed VSS is unconditionally secure},
