abstract = {Wireless networks are passing through a transition phase for the past few years now and this transition is giving a way towards the convergence of all IP-based networks to form the Next Generation Networks (NGNs). With the proliferation of these networks in daily life, users' needs are also increasing and service operators are offering different services to satisfy their customers for a better grade of service and an elevated quality of experience (QoE). However, a single operator cannot fulfill the huge demands of the users especially, if a user is nomadic. In nomadism, a user traverses number of available networks that might contain cellular or wireless data networks, usually known as heterogeneous wireless networks. These networks offer various services from email to live video streaming depending upon their capacity and nature. During this traversing procedure, a user switches among different networks to satisfy his/her needs in terms of quality of service. This process is commonly known as a vertical handover or handoff (VHO) due to the involvement of heterogeneous wireless networks in it. An extensive work has been carried out in this field in order to fulfill user demands for better QoS and QoE. In this paper, we give a detailed state-of-the-art of these existing vertical handover decision mechanisms that aim at providing ubiquitous connectivity to the mobile users. We have categorized these vertical handover measurement and decision schemes on the basis of their employed techniques and parameters. Also, we present a comprehensive summary of their advantages and drawbacks. This paper gives its readers an overview of the active research initiatives in the area of handover decision making process in heterogeneous wireless networks and identifies the challenges behind the seamless services provisioning during mobility.},

abstract = {In this paper we present the design of a wearable device that reads positive facial expressions using physiological signals. We first analyze facial morphology in 3 dimensions and facial electromyographic signals on different facial locations and show that we can detect electromyographic signals with high amplitude on areas of low facial mobility on the side of the face, which are correlated to ones obtained from electrodes on traditional surface electromyographic capturing positions on top of facial muscles on the front of the face. We use a Multi-attribute Decision-making method to find adequate electrode positions on the side of face to capture these signals. Based on this analysis, we design and implement an ergonomic wearable device with high reliability. Because the signals are recorded distally, the proposed device uses Independent Component Analysis and an Artificial Neural Network to analyze them and achieve a high facial expression recognition rate on the side of the face. The recognized emotional facial expressions through the wearable interface device can be recorded during therapeutic interventions and for long-term facial expression recognition to quantify and infer the user’s affective state in order to support medical professionals.},

@article{Hoflinger2012,
abstract = {In this paper, we present a novel smartphone indoor localization system. The smartphone user is localized with small effort, affordable equipment and with high accuracy in indoor areas. The system uses commercially available smartphones generating high pitched acoustic chirp signals beyond the audible range. The chirp signals are received by sound receivers which identify the specific sound produced from each smartphone. The receivers are connected to a WiFi network, such that they synchronize their clocks and exchange the time differences of arrival (TDoA) of the received chirps. In this way, using an iterative multilateration algorithm, the location of the smartphones can be calculated and the receiver positions are calibrated automatically. For generating the specific sound signals from the smartphone and for user navigation an Android software application was developed. The user interface is simple and is invoked by starting the software application, which automatically connects to a server and receives an ID using the internet connection of the smartphone. Furthermore, the user is assigned specific parameters, such that several devices can be distinguished by the appearance of the chirps. The position of the user is displayed on the smartphone in context of the environment, with a map and surrounding items. In the presented work we have verified our system in a real-world scenario. We compared our trajectory of a pedestrian carrying smartphone to the reference positions. We could locate the smartphones with error margin of 30 cm. a centimeter margin of error.},

abstract = {Verifiable secret sharing (VSS) has been extensively used as a cryptographic tool in many applications of information security in recent years. A VSS enables a dealer to divide a secret s into n shares and allows shareholders to verify whether their shares are generated by the dealer consistently without revealing the secrecy of both shares and the secret. More specifically, shareholders can verify that (i) the secret can be recovered by any t or more than t shares and (ii) the secret cannot be obtained by fewer than t shares. Many VSSs are based on polynomial, and only a few of them are based on the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT). Recently, Harn et al. proposed a CRT-based VSS in which multiple verification secrets are used during the phase of verification. In this paper, we propose a VSS based on Asmuth-Bloom’s(t, n)SS scheme, which depends on the CRT. Our proposed VSS is simpler and more efficient than the scheme of Harn et al. Our proposed VSS is unconditionally secure},

abstract = {We consider the motion of a spinning relativistic particle in external electromagnetic and gravitational fields, to first order in the external field, but to an arbitrary order in spin. The noncovariant spin formalism is crucial for the correct description of the influence of the spin on the particle trajectory. We show that the true coordinate of a relativistic spinning particle is its naive, common coordinate. Concrete calculations are performed up to second order in spin included. A simple derivation is presented for the gravitational spin-orbit and spin-spin interactions of a relativistic particle. We discuss the gravimagnetic moment (GM), a specific spin effect in general relativity. It is shown that for the Kerr black hole the gravimagnetic ratio, i.e., the coefficient at the GM, equals unity (just as for the charged Kerr hole the gyromagnetic ratio equals two). The equations of motion obtained for relativistic spinning particle in external gravitational field differ essentially from the Papapetrou equations.},

abstract = {The migration from 3rd generation mobile communication networks to 4th generation, purely IP-based networks leads to new chances, but also great risks for the traditional mobile network operators, as competition increases dramatically. While this competition potentially improves the cost-value ratio for mobile users, they might well find their freedom of seamless session mobility abruptly end at the administrative borders of wireless Internet service providers. We describe a possible and in our opinion likely scenario for future mobile wireless access, point out the inherent problem of current IP mobility management schemes when it comes to inter-provider handovers, have a look at why control over this process is currently shared between the network and the mobile end-devices, and describe approaches to shift the major part of control back to the user.},

@article{MinLiu2008,
abstract = {In heterogeneous wireless networks, handoff can be separated into two parts: horizontal handoff (HHO) and vertical handoff (VHO). VHO plays an important role to fulfill seamless data transfer when mobile nodes cross wireless access networks with different link layer technologies. Current VHO algorithms mainly focus on when to trigger VHO, but neglect the problem of how to synthetically consider all currently available networks (homogeneous or heterogeneous) and choose the optimal network for HHO or VHO from all the available candidates. In this paper, we present an analytical framework to evaluate VHO algorithms. Subsequently, we extend the traditional hysteresis based and dwelling-timer based algorithms to support both VHO and HHO decisions and apply them to complex heterogeneous wireless environments. We refer to these enhanced algorithms as E-HY and E-DW, respectively. Based on the proposed analytical model, we provide a formalization definition of the handoff conditions in E-HY and E-DW and analyze their performance. Subsequently, we propose a novel general handoff decision algorithm, GHO, to trigger HHO and VHO in heterogeneous wireless networks. Analysis shows that GHO can achieve better performance than E-HY and E-DW. Simulations validate the analytical results and verify that GHO outperforms traditional algorithms in terms of the matching ratio, TCP throughput and UDP throughput.},

abstract = {Vertical handover in heterogeneous wireless networks is a strategic decision due to its profound impact on mobile applications and their performance. Primarily it's an issue of network availability and secondarily it is a question of choosing best available service. This paper presents a Cross-layer Vertical Handover (CVH) decision model that maintains the pre-decision load of vertical handover processing on two layers i.e. application layer and a thin shim layer between the network and data link layer. A matchmaker service help in handover decision on the basis of best match of application demands with available connectivity options. The results show low-latency, highly consistent vertical handovers during mobility and improved performance of applications with respect to throughput and reliability.},

@article{Tang2010,
abstract = {Energy conversation is a critical problem in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) so that the energy consumption must be minimized while satisfying application requirements. The energy efficiency can be supported across all layers of the protocol stack. In this paper, we propose and analyze a cross-layer energy efficiency model, which takes routing layer, MAC layer, data link layer, hardware circuitry, and battery discharge nonlinearity into account. For successfully delivering all data generated by source nodes to the sink node with minimal network energy consumption, we consider two orthogonal modulation schemes of M-ary pulse position modulation (PPM) and frequency shift keying (FSK), and distribute an appropriate time slot to every link so that the optimal routing can be obtained. Based on the model, we formulate the optimization problem of minimizing network energy consumption and solve it by existed approaches. The numerical results show that, if PPM scheme is adopted, the cross-layer energy efficiency model with optimal routing has up to 99{\%} lower network energy consumption than that with a uniform single-hop routing in general WSN, and the optimal model also exists 93{\%} energy saving if FSK is used. Multi-hop routing is more energy efficiency than single-hop routing in general WSN, while single-hop routing is more preferable in dense WSN.},
