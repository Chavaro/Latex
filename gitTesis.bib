@article{Eysenbach2001,
abstract = {Everybody talks about e-health these days, but few people have come up with a clear definition of this comparatively new term. Barely in use before 1999, this term now seems to serve as a general "buzzword," used to characterize not only "Internet medicine", but also virtually everything related to computers and medicine. The term was apparently first used by industry leaders and marketing people rather than academics. They created and used this term in line with other "e-words" such as e-commerce, e-business, e-solutions, and so on, in an attempt to convey the promises, principles, excitement (and hype) around e-commerce (electronic commerce) to the health arena, and to give an account of the new possibilities the Internet is opening up to the area of health care. Intel, for example, referred to e-health as "a concerted effort undertaken by leaders in health care and hi-tech industries to fully harness the benefits available through convergence of the Internet and health care." Because the Internet created new opportunities and challenges to the traditional health care information technology industry, the use of a new term to address these issues seemed appropriate. These "new" challenges for the health care information technology industry were mainly (1) the capability of consumers to interact with their systems online (B2C = "business to consumer"); (2) improved possibilities for institution-to-institution transmissions of data (B2B = "business to business"); (3) new possibilities for peer-to-peer communication of consumers (C2C = "consumer to consumer").},

@article{McNair2004,
abstract = {Revolutionary drivers for 4G include a push toward universal wireless access and ubiquitous computing through seamless personal and terminal mobility. One of the major challenges for seamless mobility is the criterion of a vertical handoff protocol: a handoff protocol for users that move between different types of networks. Traditional operations for handoff detection policies, decision metrics, and radio link transfer are not able to adapt to dynamic handoff criteria or react to user inputs and changing network availabilities. Nor are they able to deliver context-aware services or ensure network interoperability. Thus, new techniques are needed to manage user mobility between different types of networks. This article presents a tutorial on the design and performance issues for vertical hand-off in an envisioned multinetwork fourth-generation environment. Various network architectures and technologies for 3G and beyond are described, including wireless LANs, cellular, satellite, and Mobile IP. Then the problem of vertical handoff is defined in the context of such a diverse network environment. Finally, research efforts to resolve the open problems are explored, including new techniques for dynamic handoff decision and detection algorithms and context-aware radio link transfer},

In heterogeneous wireless$\backslash$nnetworks, handoff can be separated into two parts: horizontal handoff$\backslash$n(HHO) and vertical handoff (VHO). VHO plays an important role to$\backslash$nfulfill seamless data transfer when mobile nodes cross wireless access$\backslash$nnetworks with different link layer technologies. Current VHO algorithms$\backslash$nmainly focus on when to trigger VHO to improve connection QoS, but$\backslash$nneglect the problem of how to synthetically consider all currently$\backslash$navailable networks (homogeneous or heterogeneous) and choose the$\backslash$noptimal network for HHO or VHO from all available candidates. In$\backslash$nthis paper, we present an analytical framework to evaluate VHO algorithms.$\backslash$nThis framework can be used to provide guidelines for optimization$\backslash$nof handoff in heterogeneous wireless networks. Subsequently, we extend$\backslash$nthe traditional hysteresis based and dwelling-timer based algorithms$\backslash$nto support both VHO and HHO decisions and apply them to complex heterogeneous$\backslash$nwireless environments. We refer to these enhanced algorithms as E-HY$\backslash$nand E-DW, respectively. Based on the proposed analytical model, we$\backslash$nprovide a formalization definition of the handoff conditions in E-HY$\backslash$nand E-DW and analyze their performance. Subsequently, we propose$\backslash$na novel general handoff decision algorithm, GHO, to trigger HHO and$\backslash$nVHO in heterogeneous wireless networks at the appropriate time. Analysis$\backslash$nshows that GHO can achieve better performance than E-HY and E-DW.$\backslash$nSimulations validate the analytical results and verify that GHO outperforms$\backslash$ntraditional algorithms in terms of the matching ratio, TCP throughput$\backslash$nand UDP throughput.},

@article{Zimmermann1980,
abstract = {Considering the urgency of the need for standards which would allow constitution of heterogeneous computer networks, ISO created a new subcommittee for "Open Systems Interconnection" (ISO/ TC97/SC 16) in 1977. The first priority of subcommittee 16 was to develop an architecture for open systems interconnection which could serve as a framework for the definition of standard protocols. As a result of 18 months of studies and discussions, SC16 adopted a layered architecture comprising seven layers (Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, and Application). In July 1979 the specifications of this architecture, established by SC16, were passed under the name of "OSI Reference Model" to Technical Committee 97 "Data Processing" along with recommendations to start officially, on this basis, a set of protocols standardization projects to cover the most urgent needs. These recommendations were adopted by T.C97 at the end of 1979 as the basis for the following development of standards for Open Systems Interconnectlon within ISO. The OSI Reference Model was also recognized by CCITT Rapporteur's Group on "Layered Model for Public Data Network Services." This paper presents the model of architecture for Open Systems Interconnection developed by SC16. Some indications are also given on the initial set of protocols which will-likely be developed in this OSI Reference Model.},

abstract = {Targeting an increasing number of potential application domains, wireless sensor networks (WSN) have been the subject of intense research, in an attempt to optimize their performance while guaranteeing reliability in highly demanding scenarios. However, hardware constraints have limited their application, and real deployments have demonstrated that WSNs have difficulties in coping with complex communication tasks - such as mobility - in addition to application-related tasks. Mobility support in WSNs is crucial for a very high percentage of application scenarios and, most notably, for the Internet of Things. It is, thus, important to know the existing solutions for mobility in WSNs, identifying their main characteristics and limitations. With this in mind, we firstly present a survey of models for mobility support in WSNs. We then present the Network of Proxies (NoP) assisted mobility proposal, which relieves resource-constrained WSN nodes from the heavy procedures inherent to mobility management. The presented proposal was implemented and evaluated in a real platform, demonstrating not only its advantages over conventional solutions, but also its very good performance in the simultaneous handling of several mobile nodes, leading to high handoff success rate and low handoff time. ?? 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Finally, we propose GARFID, a concept for using advanced technologies for teaching young children. The main outcome of this research is that the concept of UCF raises a lot of possibilities, which can bring value and benefits for end-users.

abstract = {To support real-time applications such as Voice-over-IP within an 802.11 Wireless LAN, efficient handoff mechanisms are required when a mobile client moves from one Access Point to another. In this paper, we present the design, implementation and performance results of MAC layer (layer-2) handoff algorithms which implement make-before-break mechanisms at the MAC layer unlike current algorithms that are based on break-before-make. As a baseline, we first present an algorithm that uses a single radio card on the client (as is done traditionally), but optimizes MAC layer handoff by periodically probing in the background for Access Points on other channels even when it is already associated with an Access Point and actively sending and receiving data. We then present two novel algorithms that use two radio cards on the client so that when one card is involved in communicating data, the other card can probe for neighboring Access Points. Of these multiple radio algorithms, the first one uses dedicated data and control cards at the client thereby implementing a soft version of make-before-break. The second algorithm uses two cards which can both perform control and data forwarding functions thereby implementing a strict version of make-before-break. Experimental results from a prototype implementation show that the make-before-brake algorithms lead to a significant reduction in MAC layer handoff overhead; the algorithm for the strict version of the make-before-break mechanism leads to sub 10 millisecond hand-off latency.},

While this competition potentially improves the cost-value ratio for mobile users, they might well find their freedom of seamless session mobility abruptly end at the administrative borders of wireless Internet service providers. We describe a possible and in our opinion likely scenario for future mobile wireless access, point out the inherent problem of current IP mobility management schemes when it comes to inter-provider handovers, have a look at why control over this process is currently shared between the network and the mobile end-devices, and describe approaches to shift the major part of control back to the user.},

The fourth generation of wireless communications is expected to integrate a potentially large number of heterogeneous wireless technologies in what could be considered a huge step forward toward universal seamless access. One of the main challenges for seamless mobility is the availability of reliable horizontal (intrasystem) and vertical (intersystem) handoff schemes. Efficient handoff schemes enhance quality of service and provide flawless mobility. This article presents different and novel aspects of handoff and discusses handoff related issues of fourth generation systems. Desirable handoff features are presented. Handoff decisions, radio link transfer, and channel assignment are described as stages of the complete handoff process. A vertical handoff decision function, which enables devices to assign weights to different network parameters, is also presented},

The noncovariant spin formalism is crucial for the correct description of the influence of the spin on the particle trajectory. We show that the true coordinate of a relativistic spinning particle is its naive, common coordinate. Concrete calculations are performed up to second order in spin included. A simple derivation is presented for the gravitational spin-orbit and spin-spin interactions of a relativistic particle. We discuss the gravimagnetic moment (GM), a specific spin effect in general relativity. It is shown that for the Kerr black hole the gravimagnetic ratio, i.e., the coefficient at the GM, equals unity (just as for the charged Kerr hole the gyromagnetic ratio equals two). The equations of motion obtained for relativistic spinning particle in external gravitational field differ essentially from the Papapetrou equations.},

abstract = {In ubiquitous networks, Mobile Nodes (MNs) may often suffer from performance degradation due to the following two reasons: (1)reduction of signal strength by an MN's movement and intervening objects, and (2) radio interference with other WLANs. Therefore, quick and reliable detection of the deterioration of a wireless link condition is essential for avoiding the degradation of the communication quality during handover. In our previous works, we focused on a handover decision criterion allowing MNs to maintain communication quality and stated the problems of existing decision criteria. Furthermore, we showed the effectiveness of the number of frame retransmissions through simulation experiments. However, a comparison between signal strength and the number of frame retransmissions could not be examined due to the unreliability of signal strength in simulations. Therefore, in this paper, by employing FTP and VoIP applications, we compare signal strength and the number of frame retransmissions as a handover decision criterion with experiments in terms of (1) and (2) in a real environment. Finally, we show the problems of signal strength in contrast to the effectiveness of the number of frame retransmissions as a handover decision criterion.},

We solve this model by transforming it into simpler sub-problems that can be solved using conventional methods. We then propose a TDMA scheduling algorithm based on the input derived from the cross-layer optimization model. The proposed algorithm utilizes the slot reuse concept, which significantly reduces the end-to-end latency in WSNs, while retaining the feature of energy efficiency. In addition, the proposed solution in this paper is applied to clustered WSNs. This feature facilitates the application of our approach in large size WSNs.},

abstract = {Wireless networks are passing through a transition phase for the past few years now and this transition is giving a way towards the convergence of all IP-based networks to form the Next Generation Networks (NGNs). With the proliferation of these networks in daily life, users' needs are also increasing and service operators are offering different services to satisfy their customers for a better grade of service and an elevated quality of experience (QoE). However, a single operator cannot fulfill the huge demands of the users especially, if a user is nomadic. In nomadism, a user traverses number of available networks that might contain cellular or wireless data networks, usually known as heterogeneous wireless networks. These networks offer various services from email to live video streaming depending upon their capacity and nature. During this traversing procedure, a user switches among different networks to satisfy his/her needs in terms of quality of service. This process is commonly known as a vertical handover or handoff (VHO) due to the involvement of heterogeneous wireless networks in it. An extensive work has been carried out in this field in order to fulfill user demands for better QoS and QoE. In this paper, we give a detailed state-of-the-art of these existing vertical handover decision mechanisms that aim at providing ubiquitous connectivity to the mobile users. We have categorized these vertical handover measurement and decision schemes on the basis of their employed techniques and parameters. Also, we present a comprehensive summary of their advantages and drawbacks. This paper gives its readers an overview of the active research initiatives in the area of handover decision making process in heterogeneous wireless networks and identifies the challenges behind the seamless services provisioning during mobility.},

We use a Multi-attribute Decision-making method to find adequate electrode positions on the side of face to capture these signals. Based on this analysis, we design and implement an ergonomic wearable device with high reliability. Because the signals are recorded distally, the proposed device uses Independent Component Analysis and an Artificial Neural Network to analyze them and achieve a high facial expression recognition rate on the side of the face. The recognized emotional facial expressions through the wearable interface device can be recorded during therapeutic interventions and for long-term facial expression recognition to quantify and infer the user's affective state in order to support medical professionals.},

Several methods are emerging to achieve this signalling in layered protocol stacks. Through these methods, the refined wireless systems are expected to gain significant performance improvement and/or obtain extended functionality that is very hard if not impossible to obtain from a single layer signalling. This paper begins with a survey of representative cross-layer signalling methods. Based on the analysis, the paper proposes an efficient, flexible and comprehensive scheme defined here as cross-layer signalling shortcuts (CLASS), and then a set of evaluation criteria is defined to compare CLASS with current schemes. Finally, the possible application areas of CLASS are identified, and a reference application programme is presented for applying CLASS into various management areas.},

abstract = {Energy conversation is a critical problem in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) so that the energy consumption must be minimized while satisfying application requirements. The energy efficiency can be supported across all layers of the protocol stack. In this paper, we propose and analyze a cross-layer energy efficiency model, which takes routing layer, MAC layer, data link layer, hardware circuitry, and battery discharge nonlinearity into account. For successfully delivering all data generated by source nodes to the sink node with minimal network energy consumption, we consider two orthogonal modulation schemes of M-ary pulse position modulation (PPM) and frequency shift keying (FSK), and distribute an appropriate time slot to every link so that the optimal routing can be obtained. Based on the model, we formulate the optimization problem of minimizing network energy consumption and solve it by existed approaches. The numerical results show that, if PPM scheme is adopted, the cross-layer energy efficiency model with optimal routing has up to 99{\%} lower network energy consumption than that with a uniform single-hop routing in general WSN, and the optimal model also exists 93{\%} energy saving if FSK is used. Multi-hop routing is more energy efficiency than single-hop routing in general WSN, while single-hop routing is more preferable in dense WSN.},

abstract = {The performance of applications on mobile devices is affected by the device constraints of memory, processing power, battery life and the variations in the wireless network. The variations in the wireless network will be compounded in the next generation networks - 3G and beyond - when the devices move across heterogeneous networks. To allow interoperability with the Internet, existing standard protocol stacks would be deployed in the new networks and mobile devices. However, these protocol stacks which are architected and implemented in a layered manner do not function efficiently in mobile wireless environments. Cross-layer feedback in the protocol stack would be useful to improve the efficiency of these protocol stacks. In this paper, we discuss the benefits of cross-layer feedback on the mobile device and present a representative survey. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The current Internet protocol (IP) architecture model for mobile ad hoc network (MANET) routing protocol development ignores cross-layer effects by seeking to emulate as closely as possible the wireline architecture. Nevertheless, cross-layer effects are unavoidable and it is actually desirable to exploit these interactions to achieve greater performance. Further, support for cross-layer information flow is necessary for many of the applications envisioned for MANETs. We review the purpose of the IP architecture and argue that the MANET architecture model is not only unsuitable for exploiting cross-layer effects it also violates the very intent of the IP architecture. By focusing the standardization effort on making routing solutions and placing them at the point of integration, just above IP in the protocol stack, it effectively stifles the IP development goals of supporting local subnetwork optimization and long term innovation. We review issues of cross-layer design and then propose an alternative standardization effort that would preserve the opportunity for innovation while ensuring the integration of MANET subnetworks into larger integrated heterogeneous IP networks. Our proposal places MANET into its own subnetworking layer and then divides standardization into four parts: the interface to the MANET subnetwork, a heterogeneous routing protocol, mechanisms for cross-layer information flow, and a combined logical and spatially hierarchical addressing scheme. We identify several more radical MANET design proposals that depart substantially from the current model. All could be integrated into a larger heterogeneous IP network using our protocol approach},

abstract = {Future wireless networks should facilitate efficient communication for rapidly growing bandwidth intensive applications. The existing layered protocol stack lacks efficiency in handling such applications. Cross-layer interactions can operate within the existing protocol stack and are a promising solution. In this article we present a survey of cross-layer interactions in wireless networks. We classify the cross-layer solutions based on the nature of the adaptation using a systematic evaluation of existing approaches. We identify critical criteria applicable to generic cross-layer framework design. Further, we analyze the existing generic cross-layer frameworks and qualitatively compare them based on the identified criteria. Context awareness is an essential and important element of future pervasive and wireless technologies. We propose to consider the context awareness as an essential and important aspect in cross-layer interactions and adaptations. We discuss context parameters with respect to adaptations that can be enabled at the layered protocol stack. Finally, we discuss open research challenges and gaps to be filled in cross-layer interactions in wireless networks.},

abstract = {As sensor nodes are typically powered by non- renewable batteries, energy efficiency is a critical factor in wire- less sensor networks (WSNs). Orthogonal modulations appro- priate for the energy-limited WSN setup have been investigated under the assumption that batteries are linear and ideal, but their effectiveness is not guaranteed when more realistic nonlinear battery models are considered. In this paper, based on a general model that integrates typical WSN transmission and reception modules with realistic battery models, we derive two battery power-conserving schemes for two M-ary orthogonal modula- tions, namely pulse position modulation (PPM) and frequency shift keying (FSK), both tailored for WSNs. Then we analyze and compare the battery power efficiency of PPM and FSK over various wireless channel models. Our results reveal that FSK is more power-efficient than PPM in sparse WSNs, while PPM may outperform FSK in dense WSNs. We also show that in sparse WSNs, the power advantage of FSK over PPM is no more than 3dB; whereas in very denseWSNs, the power advantage of PPM over FSK can be much more significant as the constellation size M increases.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present a novel smartphone indoor localization system. The smartphone user is localized with small effort, affordable equipment and with high accuracy in indoor areas. The system uses commercially available smartphones generating high pitched acoustic chirp signals beyond the audible range. The chirp signals are received by sound receivers which identify the specific sound produced from each smartphone. The receivers are connected to a WiFi network, such that they synchronize their clocks and exchange the time differences of arrival (TDoA) of the received chirps. In this way, using an iterative multilateration algorithm, the location of the smartphones can be calculated and the receiver positions are calibrated automatically. For generating the specific sound signals from the smartphone and for user navigation an Android software application was developed. The user interface is simple and is invoked by starting the software application, which automatically connects to a server and receives an ID using the internet connection of the smartphone. Furthermore, the user is assigned specific parameters, such that several devices can be distinguished by the appearance of the chirps. The position of the user is displayed on the smartphone in context of the environment, with a map and surrounding items. In the presented work we have verified our system in a real-world scenario. We compared our trajectory of a pedestrian carrying smartphone to the reference positions. We could locate the smartphones with error margin of 30 cm. a centimeter margin of error.},

Due to the complexity and heavy traffic of the legacy location-awareness techniques, simultaneous locationing and tracking of numerous mobile nodes in real-time is not easy. To address this problem, we propose the three-tier middleware architecture called uMATI (ubiquitous Mobile Asset Tracking Infra). In the uMATI, all nodes (stationary and mobile) commonly use the IEEE 802.15.4 MAC protocol to guarantee the compatibility with the legacy wireless sensor network (WSN) despite of mobile-stationary nodes co-existence network. To solve the bidirectional tracking in spite of the free mobility of the numerous mobile nodes, we firstly suggest a simple bidirectional location protocol called BLIDx (bidirectional location ID exchange) and its implementation into both the mobile and stationary nodes. In addition, to prevent the traffic overflow due to the concentration of excessive mobile nodes into a single location, we propose adding a specially designed stationary node called virtual sink (VS) node and installing related middleware components into the node. Results from the experimental evaluation prove that the proposed architecture enhanced the practicability by effectively supporting the mobility and managing the traffic in the real-time mobile asset tracking applications. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Based on the DVB-T standard, DVB-H adds new features such as time slicing, MPE-FEC, in-depth interleavers, mandatory cell id identifier, optional 4K-modulation mode and the use of 5 MHz bandwidth in addition to the usually used 6, 7, or 8 MHz raster. IPDC over DVB-H is proposed for ETSI to complement the DVB-H standard by combining IPDC and DVB-H in an end-to-end system. Handover in such unidirectional broadcasting networks is a novel issue. In the last few years since the birth of DVB-H technology, great attention has been given to the performance analysis of DVB-H mobile terminals. Handover is one of the main research topics for DVB-H in mobile scenarios. Better reception quality and greater power efficiency are considered to be the main targets of handover research for DVB-H. New algorithms for different handover stages in DVB-H have been the subject of recent research and are currently being studied. Further novel algorithms need to be designed to improve the mobile reception quality. This article provides a comprehensive survey of the handover algorithms in DVB-H. A systematic evaluation and categorization approach is proposed based on the problems the algorithms solve and the handover stages being focused on. Criteria are proposed and analyzed to facilitate designing better handover algorithms for DVB-H that have been identified from the research conducted by the authors.},

However, the encapsulation results in some side effects, including compromise of QoS, latency, extra overload, etc. Therefore, to mitigate the side effect of the encapsulation between the abstract layers in the TCP/IP model, a number of cross-layer designs have been proposed. Cross-layer designs allow information sharing among all of the five layers in order to improve the wireless network functionality, including security, QoS, and mobility. In this article, we classify cross-layer designs by two ways. On the one hand, by how to share information among the five layers, cross-layer designs can be classified into two categories: non-manager method and manager method. On the other hand, by the organization of the network, cross-layer designs can be classified into two categories: centralized method and distributed method. Furthermore, we summarize the challenges of the cross-layer designs, including coexistence, signaling, the lack of a universal cross-layer design, and the destruction of the layered architecture.},

abstract = {Wireless sensors networks (WSN) are getting a special place in the development of e-Health application, due to its characteristics such as: not intrusive design, low energy consumption, low price and its flexibility to integrate into health care environments. However, the use of WSN in these kind of environments must consider those security and privacy mechanisms required by applicable personal data protection legislations to provide end-to-end guarantees to the patient's information. Applications and research projects are taking place to offer e-Health solutions with these features, however still there is not framework or standard to support interoperability among these or to provide a design criteria for future developments. Towards this goal, in this paper we survey a set of e-Health proposals for WSN, focusing on the mechanisms used to provide security and privacy to support real-time and multimedia data transmission in WSN.},

abstract = {In future wireless communication networks, seamless handoff either by vertical or horizontal is an important issue in radio resource management. For a vertical handoff (VHO), each candidate network is evaluated as a function of multiple attributes such as available bandwidth, delay, data rate, and cost, etc. However, the variations of these parameters and distributed VHO decisions might cause the instability of VHO decisions, which is inefficient in utilizing network resources due to frequent handoffs. In this letter, we propose a service history-based VHO algorithm to reduce unnecessary handoffs and call dropping probability in addition to QoS parameter considerations. Simulation results show that the proposed VHO algorithm outperforms existing algorithms.},

abstract = {Inability to meet the key requirement of efficient mobility support is becoming a major impairment of wireless sensor network (WSN). Many critical WSN applications need not only reliability, but also the ability to adequately cope with the movement of nodes between different sub-networks. Despite the work of IETF's 6lowPAN WG and work on the use of MIPv6 (and many of its variants) in WSNs, no practical mobility support solution exists for this type of networks. In this paper we start by assessing the use of MIPv6 in WSNs, considering soft and hard handoff, showing that, although feasible in small networks, MIPv6 complexity leads to long handoff time and high energy consumption. In order to solve these problems, we propose a proxy-based mobility approach which, by relieving resource-constrained sensor nodes from heavy mobility management tasks, drastically reduces time and energy expenditure during handoff. The evaluation of both MIPv6 and the proposed solution is done by implementation and simulation, with a varying number of nodes, sinks and mobility strategies. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Ubiquitous Technologies in eHealthcare systems are playing a vital role to perform a non-stop monitoring of patients' health in hospitals or outpatient. The application of eHealthcare System towards wireless sensor networks such as ECG, voice over IP and audio/video conferencing, location-aware and ambient intelligence require the support of mobile nodes or node groups. Furthermore, medical staff moves close to patients and collects their monitoring body parameters through their wireless devices. Thus, in such situation, the lack of network connectivity is not admissible or should at least be time bounded, e. g. mobile nodes cannot be disconnected from the rest of the WSN for an undefined period of time. In this paper, we propose a hybrid and fast authentication protocols that support fast handoff for real-time applications aforementioned. The proposed protocol is based on RSS measurement and on public key cryptography with Diffie-Hellman algorithm which provides security against both leakage-resilience of private keys on untrustworthy. The performance analysis shows that our proposed authentication protocols are efficient and resilient to various kinds of attacks.},

abstract = {Although there are various wireless access network technologies with different characteristics and performance level have been developed, no single network that can satisfy the anytime, anywhere, and any service wireless access needs of mobile users. A truly seamless mobile environment can only be realized by considering vertical and horizontal handoffs together. With the advantages of Mobile IPv6, a more comprehensive and integrated framework of heterogeneous networks can be developed. In this paper, we discuss the issues related to handoffs including horizontal and vertical handoffs. We present a scheme for integrating wireless local area network and wide area access networks, and propose a micromobility management method called HiMIPv6+. We also propose a QoS-based (quality-of-service-based) vertical handoff scheme and algorithm that consider wireless network transport capacity and user service requirement. Our prototype evaluations and the simulations show that our framework performs as expected.},

Primarily it's an issue of network availability and secondarily it is a question of choosing best available service. This paper presents a Cross-layer Vertical Handover (CVH) decision model that maintains the pre-decision load of vertical handover processing on two layers i.e. application layer and a thin shim layer between the network and data link layer. A matchmaker service help in handover decision on the basis of best match of application demands with available connectivity options. The results show low-latency, highly consistent vertical handovers during mobility and improved performance of applications with respect to throughput and reliability.},

Still, handover latency in Mobile WiMAX is an issue that may affect real-time continuity of application sessions. This is partially due to the Layer 2 scanning/ranging, as well as the network re-entry procedure, which may result in a latency of hundreds of milliseconds, far exceeding the requirement of typical real-time services (e.g., 150 ms for Voice over IP). In this paper, we describe a mechanism which incorporates information from several OSI Layers to speed up the Layer 2 handover. We show by means of simulations that this new mechanism can decrease the handover latency significantly, to less than 100 ms in most cases.},
